##About the project
Music. In today's age, we can take it anywhere with us. BlocJams is the first music player/ project I've tackled as a full stack engineer. It is essentially like Amazon's music site with the choice of albums, music, and can even play music! The BlocJams project was created by Bloc, the leading online coding school, and with the course instructions plus the guidance of my mentor, Allen Hunn, I was able to ace it.

##My Role
My job, as a student of Bloc, was to read through each checkpoint and apply any given code in my text editor. At the end of each checkpoint was an assignment. Where checkpoints were more hand holding, Assignments were more like "Here, lets throw you in deep water. You better swim now". Assignments were where I got the chance to test my knowledge from what I learned throughout the checkpoints. Good assignments, I'd say.


##Problem
This being my first project, Ill discuss not just problems I encountered with my code, but also problems I discovered with myself as a developer.

Ever spend too much time on something? And no matter how much you work on it, you just can't get the results you were looking for? I'll confess now and say that I'm one to do that on a regular basis. I've come to learn that if I am going to be working as a full stack engineer, it's highly important to take breaks. Go for a walk. Take a nap. Fly to Japan. Do anything. Something. But don't code. I've discovered that stepping back from the computer screen helps to refresh the mind and once I get back to work, pshhhh, I get through the my assignments 1 2 3.


##Take for example
I began working on DOM Scripting and for the life of me I couldn't grasp the concept of it. You're probably thinking, "What? Seriously? That's so easy to get". Well at that point, I had been coding for a few hours straight and I felt ready to give up. I closed the computer and decided not to get back on until the next day. Turns out, that's all I needed. A break. A big break. Once I got back to work, everything made lots more sense, and I can now easily work with DOM Scripting.
