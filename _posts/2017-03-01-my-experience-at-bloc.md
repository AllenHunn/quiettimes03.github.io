title: My Experience at Bloc
---

Bloc. The world's largest online coding school. Such an advantage, being able to study code in the comfort of my home!

I began studying with Bloc on January 9th, 2017. I'm almost two months into my course of study and I must say that I have learned a great deal so far. The course is broken into modules, and each module is broken into a certain amount of checkpoints. At the end of each checkpoint is an assignment.

Where the checkpoints are more hand holding, the assignments are more in place to help us promising developers think like developers. When it came time for assignments, if I was stalled on any part of it, I was able to contact my mentor (Yes! Bloc lets us choose a mentor), Allen Hunn, and he helped guide me to the right answer.
